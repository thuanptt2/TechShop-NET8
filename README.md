# TechShop Web API

## Overview

This is a Web API project built on .NET 8, following Clean Architecture principles. The objective of the project is to provide standardized APIs with features such as security, monitoring, health checks, efficient database management, and integration with external services.

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture with distinct layers:

- **Domain**: Contains entities, business rules, and interfaces.
- **Application**: Contains application logic and command handling via Mediator.
- **Infrastructure**: Provides services and connections to databases, Kafka, Redis, and other external services.
- **API**: The layer that interacts with users through APIs.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Authentication**
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication.
- API authentication is handled via **API-Key**.

### 2. **Authorization**
- Access control is managed via role-based authorization.

### 3. **Traces, Metrics, Logs**
- **OpenTelemetry** is used to collect tracing and metrics data.
- **Kafka** is used for logging, enabling real-time log processing.

### 4. **Health Check**
- Implements health checks for the main service and auxiliary services such as databases (SQL, MongoDB), Kafka via health check endpoints.

### 5. **Response Object**
- Utilizes a standardized response object containing status, message, and return data. This structure adheres to the "API Documentation Core System Standard v1.0" specification.

### 6. **Common Functions**
- Provides utility functions such as:
  - Retrieving user information from the **context**.
  - Reading/Writing JSON, Excel files, etc.
  - Date formatting.

### 7. **Database Connectivity**
- Supports **SQL**, **Redis**, and **MongoDB** with features like connection pooling, timeout management, and retry policies.

### 8. **API Versioning**
- Supports versioning to maintain backward compatibility when extending APIs.

### 9. **Global Exception Handling**
- Implements global exception handling to ensure the system remains stable without abrupt failures.

### 10. **API Call Handling**
- Uses **HttpClientFactory** to manage HTTP connections.
- **Polly** is used to configure retry policies and circuit breaker mechanisms.

### 11. **Validation**
- **FluentValidation** is used to validate incoming request data.

### 12. **Configuration**
- Manages configuration securely using **Vault**.

### 13. **Caching**
- Implements caching for resources like products using **Redis**.

### 14. **Rate Limiting**
- Implements rate limiting to ensure system stability under high load.

### 15. **Swagger**
- **Swagger** is used to generate API documentation and provide an interactive API testing interface.

### 16. **Kafka**
- Connects to **Kafka** for both producer and consumer functionality in the PubSub system.

### 17. **Dynamic Expression**
- Supports **Dynamic Expression** for executing dynamic rules.

## Infrastructure

The project uses **Docker** for deploying the environment, ensuring consistency and easy management of services.


## Installation and Running

### Developer Mode Setup

#### 1. Create the Database

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root.

2. Navigate to the `TechShopSolution.Infrastructure` folder:

   ```bash
   cd TechShopSolution.Infrastructure
   ```

3. Run the following command to create a new migration for the database schema:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitDatabaseMigration --startup-project ../TechShopSolution.API/
   ```

4. After running the migration command, ensure the system creates the database named `techshop`. This can typically be done by running:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../TechShopSolution.API/
   ```

#### 2. Docker Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `upgrade-dev-infras` folder by running:

   ```bash
   cd upgrade-dev-infras
   ```

2. Start the Docker infrastructure by running:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This will set up the necessary services like Kafka, Redis, and MongoDB.

#### 3. Build and Run the API

1. Navigate to the `TechShopSolution.API` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../TechShopSolution.API
   ```

2. Build the API project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the API:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

API should now be running in developer mode with the necessary infrastructure services provided by Docker and the `TechShop` database created.
